Although project one was arguably the easiest, it was the most fun to make for me. This project required that we make a program which displays a 24 hour, as well as a 12 hour clock. You had to be able to add increments of time, as well as open the menu and exit the program. I thought I did the general organiziation and functions of the project well. I still need more practice with getting things to "print" a menu in a more neat fashion. I definitely could have been more concise with my functions, but I didn't want to risk going outside the scope of the class. There were a lot of interesting tools I learned about while watching different videos and googled different helpful guides. A lot of the time people on forums will just post the answer, but there is a lot of good knowledge in the comment section 90% of the time. I think just abouit every skill that was applied in this project will continue to help me/my career. From basic programming to making display menus, it all applies somewhere! I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by first making it not. I just wrote the program as I saw fit, then after watching some videos I realized there was a lot that I could do better.
